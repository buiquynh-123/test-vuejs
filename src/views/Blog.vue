            Signal exists to provide people everywhere with a tool for real
            private communication. That’s our only goal, and we take it very
            seriously. We’re structured as a nonprofit to ensure that market
            forces can never put profit or expediency over the safety of those
            who rely on us. Our work also resonates beyond the Signal app. The
            Signal Protocol has become the foundation for end-to-end encryption
            technology that is used and trusted by many private messaging
            services to protect billions of messages every day.
